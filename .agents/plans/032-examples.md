## Implementation Notes

1. **Self-contained**: Each example should be runnable standalone with minimal setup.

2. **Comments**: Include clear comments explaining each step of the workflow.

3. **Error handling**: Show proper error handling patterns (try/catch, checking for null fields).

4. **Real fixtures**: Use actual PDF files from `fixtures/` where appropriate, or create simple PDFs within the example.

5. **Output**: Examples should either save a file to demonstrate the result or print meaningful output to the console.

6. **TypeScript**: All examples should be in TypeScript with proper type annotations.

7. **No external dependencies**: Examples should only depend on `@libpdf/core` and standard APIs (fs, fetch).
